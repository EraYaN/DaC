This is the file 'seadif/trout.error' which was created by
the program 'trout' on Mon Sep 23 10:14:22 2013
Trout was verifying the netlist description of
your circuit circuit 'ram' with the current layout in seadali.
The following nets in the layout are not according to
the netlist description of circuit 'ram'. They are also
marked in the layout.
