abstract={Comparison of digital and analog figures-of-merit of FinFETs and planar bulk MOSFETs reveals an interesting trade-off in analog/RF design space. It is seen that FinFETs possess key advantages over bulk FETs for applications around 5 GHz where the performance-power trade-off is important. In case of higher frequency applications bulk MOSFETs are shown to hold the advantage on account of their higher transconductance (Gm), provided a degraded voltage gain and a higher leakage current can be tolerated},

abstract={Three different non-planar MOSFETs including FinFET, and rectangular/circuiar gate-all-around (GAA) MOSFETs are compared based on the same electrostatic parameter-scale length. Device characteristics and intrinsic gate delay are predicted using 3-D numerical simulations. FinFET is found to have an advantage in speed though it is most sensitive to process variation on the fin width as compared with the GAA counterpart. Due to limited drive current of each GAA MOSFET, multiple wire or stack wire will be needed when performance is of concern.},
