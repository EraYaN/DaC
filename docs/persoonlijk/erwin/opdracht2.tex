\section{Summary}
FinFETs can have a higher voltage gain and lower leak current. FinFETs also have an excellent subthreshold slope and reduced $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{VSTAT}}$. So FinFETs are better suited voor low frequency, digital and energy efficient RF applications, so anything to do with sending and receiving something digital at the 5 Ghz mark and below. \cite{1609503}

FinFETs have also shown the advantage of better performance speed wise. Although they are really sensitive to their actual dimensions and thus to manufacturing errors. \cite{Liao20139}
Problems with the scaling of bulk CMOS FETs are less of a problem for multigates FETs like FinFETs.\cite{5318794}
